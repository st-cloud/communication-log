   <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
   <p>Check confirmed...light the fires and kick the tires, or whatever.</p>
   <p>Roger that, captain. Godspeed!</p>
   <p>Uh, control, there's a problem up here.  All the dials say "uh oh" and the lab test monkey is flipping out. I didn't even know we had a monkey up here until about
       thirty seconds ago.  Please advise.
   </p>
   <p>I don't know what to tell you, captain. The monkeys of the lab test reserve here at base camp are mounting a mutiny. They already chased off the rest of the crew; I am currently hiding in the broom closet. It looks like you're on your own. Omg... I think I here them coming. Help!!</p>
   <p>You're telling me this was planned? I told corporate that giving them the brain serum was a bad idea.  Am I the only one here that's ever watched a sci-fi movie?!? King Kong? Planet of the apes? Freaking Encino Man?!!?? None of it ever ends well!</p>
